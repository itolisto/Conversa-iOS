/**
 * The PFSearchQueue class assists in UI based searches,
 * where the database is tasked in keeping up with the user's typing.
 *
 * Here's how it works:
 * - The user enters a new character in the search field.
 * - You enqueue the proper query, and asynchronously start the search using performSearchWithQueue.
 * - Rather than performing every single search (for every single enqueued query),
 *   this class performs the most recent query.
 *
 * This class is thread-safe.
